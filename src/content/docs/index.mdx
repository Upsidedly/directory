## Why does this exist?

As the creator of this information portal website for our Discord server,
my primary goal was to enhance the overall user experience and community engagement.
I wanted to provide a central hub where our members could easily access critical information, event details, and essential resources,
ultimately fostering a sense of organization and efficiency within our server. By offering a repository of server rules, guidelines,
and announcements, I aimed to create a transparent and user-friendly environment, ensuring that both newcomers and long-time
members could navigate and participate effectively. Additionally, the website acts as a historical archive, showcasing our server's journey and evolution, introducing our staff members, and featuring other relevant content to enrich our members' connection with our community. My hope is that this website serves as a valuable tool, strengthening our server's cohesion and ensuring that every member can enjoy their experience to the fullest.
